<h1>Week 5: Basic Metadata</h1>
<h2>Task 1: Creating a Metadata Scheme</h2>
<p>If I were to have 1000 different MEI files in my GitHub repository, these are the metadata elements I would use to describe them as I believe they are the most important:
</p>
<h3>Metadata about the file itself:</h3>
<ul>
<li>title (plus an optional subtitle if there is one): name of the transcribed piece</li>
<li>composer: name of the individual(s)/band who created the musical work</li>
<li>lyricist: name of the individual(s)/band who wrote the lyrics</li>
<li>arranger: name of the person/band responsible for the particular arrangement of the piece of music</li>
<li>encoder: name of the individual(s) that encoded the file</li>
<li>source: source from which the file was transcribed</li>
<li>size: physical size of the file itself</li>
<li>publisher: name of the individual/organisation responsible for the publication of the piece of work</li>
<li>date: date of publication</li>
<li>usage restrictions: legal statute of the work regarding its distribution, publication, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metadata about the encoding process</h3>
<ul>
<li>editorial changes: description of any editorial practices that happened during the transcription of the file</li>
<li>project description: describes the purpose for which the file was created</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metadata about the original piece (if the source of transcription is different from the original piece):</h3>
<ul>
<li>title: name of the original piece</li>
<li>arranger: name of the arranger of the original piece</li>
<li>composer: name of the individual(s) reponsible for the creation of the original musical work</li>
<li>lyricist: name of the individual(s) that wrote the lyrics for the original work</li>
<li>year: year of the orignal work's creation</li>

<h2>Task 2: Modifying the MEI file</h2>
<p>The MEI file was updated to contain the above listed metadata and can be accessed here...</p>
