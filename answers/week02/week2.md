<h1>Week 2: Notated Music</h3>
<p>For this week's task, I have decided to transcribe the popular song 'Can't Help Falling in Love' by Elvis. 
This specific arrangement was written by a user named ishcobob and can be accessed on MuseScore here - https://musescore.com/user/19599391/scores/4890706 
Originally, the arrangement is for a piano and I have transcribed it as such.
Below are screenshots of a pdf version of my MuseScore file... Alternatively, you can download the MuseScore file here...
