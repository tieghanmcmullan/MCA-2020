<h1>Week 7: Curatorial Challenges</h1>
<h2>Task 1: Updating last week's metadata</h2>
<p>I have updated last week's metadata scheme by adding information about the genre of the song. That was done by adding the < classification > 
tag within Work Description, within which I added the < genre > tag. I had already included the licensing data in week 5. 
Finally, I went over the metadata from week 5 to make sure everything formatted correctly.
