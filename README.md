# WEEK 1 - Musical Datasets

## TASK 1 - Dataset Theme

The theme of my dataset is American singer and musician, the "King of Rock and Roll", Elvis Presley. He was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. His career in music began in 1954 in Memphis, Tennessee where the aim was to combine country music with rhythm and blues. The band was made up of Elvis on rhythm acoustic guitar, lead guitarist Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black and finally drummer D.J. Fontana. In 1956, "Heartbreak Hotel" quickly became Elvis' first number 1 single and he lead the new rock n roll movement with his music and performance style. Elvis is one of my favourite performers of all time, this is why I have chosen him for my dataset theme as I feel I can explore his music and complete the tasks effectively. 

## TASK 2 - Current manifestations of data relating to my dataset

### Descriptive Data
Elvis' music like most popular artists is available on all major streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify, on these platforms the music can be organised and searched for by artist, album, song, lyrics and more. These platforms often have playlists dedicated to certain artists which are a compilation of their most popular work, for example "Elvis Presley Essentials" on Apple Music. These apps then use the music you have listened to in order to create suggestions of other music you may like, they do this by analysing descriptive data stored on the app based on your profile and what you listen to. This type of data is in the background of the app and not visible to users. However, users can view descriptive info such as the title of the song, duration, genre, year it was released, composers and songwriters, file type and size, and so much more. 

### Acoustic Data
The acoustic data can be found on all major streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify. Acoustic data is also published on Youtube by the offical Elvis youtube account and many other users in the form of live performances, covers of his music, and lyrical videos. A lot of the content on youtube isnjsut the audio recording with the album cover on screen. 

### Notated Data
In terms of notated music, there are a number of digitalised sheet music websites where you can find Elvis' songs. My favourite of these is "musicnotes.com" as it has a wide selection of his music and is very easy to navigate. It also has a filter function where you can sort the files by the artist, title, album and even instruments.
